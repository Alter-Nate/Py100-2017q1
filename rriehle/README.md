# Welcome

This folder is where I organize the class week to week.  It includes class agenda/outlines, annotated IPython notebooks from the live class, and exercise code samples.

Class materials are [available online](https://uwpce-pythoncert.github.io/Py100/build/html/index.html).

For discussion please join the class [Slack channel](https://uw2016pythoncourse.slack.com/).
